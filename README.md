# ReactJS Form Submission App

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple ReactJS application that demonstrates:
- A form with three input fields: **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Email**.
- Email validation before submission.
- Displaying submitted data in a table.
- Incrementing **Submissions Count** when the same email is submitted multiple times (instead of creating duplicate rows).

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Form Handling**: Controlled inputs using React `useState`.
- **Validation**: Basic regex check for valid email format.
- **Dynamic Table**: Displays all submissions with a count.
- **Duplicate Handling**: If the same email is submitted again, the count increases instead of adding a new row.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **ReactJS** (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS** for basic styling
